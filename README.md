My project for Unit 5 APCSA.
# Unit 5 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

My animation showcased images of activities/items that I enjoy the most. The first image I put in my project, is the city of Chicago because I always go there 1-2 times a year to visit family. The second image I picked was mint chocolate chip icecream and I displayed this because it is my favorite desert to eat. The third image i displayed was the ocean because I always enjoy going there and swimming. The last image I displayed was a race track because I am currently on the track team and enjoy running everyday. In my first 2D array, the image files and sounds are stored in a grid (2 X 2) and we can call them by giving the specific row/column when writing a method. These are the sound effects and visuals on the animation. In my second 2D array, there are multiple words that are being stored in a (3 x 3) grid. Each row of words represents details about the specific image and will get printed out on the visual. 



## Image Filter Analysis

I created 1 filter on my own called getAllBlue() and what it does is that it enchances the blue component of each pixel while reducing the amount of red and green. While the filter is running, each second it reduces the RGB value by 50 to eventually make the image entirely blue. I included a parameter inside of the method called ColorNumber and it changes or adds the amount by which blue is increased and red/green are decreased. The other filter zeroGreen() is from Unit 5 Lesson 6 - Level 7C and it removes all  green color from the image by setting the green component of each pixel to zero. This makes the image appear with only red and blue tones.
